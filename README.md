1 Introduction
Fuzzy mathematics, with its inherent flexibility, dynamic nature, and scientific basis, offers a promising alternative. This paper leverages the rough set theory from fuzzy mathematics to address uncertain and incomplete factors in football match technical indicators. Through attribute reduction, a more scientific evaluation system is established. This system evaluates the comprehensive abilities of football teams in stages via dominance analysis and cluster analysis, thus providing a robust scientific foundation for the timely adjustment and development of football teams
